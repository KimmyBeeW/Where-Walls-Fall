        <!-- Verse 1 -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">Restrictions in the guise of equality,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">walls raised in the name of protection.</span>
          <span class="line">Policies dressed as defense</span>
          <span class="line">that decide who moves "freely"</span>
          <span class="line">and those trapped darkly by the gate.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 2 -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">Division is the child of hate;</span>
          <span class="line line--red">hate is born of the fear we create.</span>
          <span class="line">Fear drawn from tales</span>
          <span class="line">passed around like the flu,</span>
          <span class="line">polished until they look like truth.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 3 -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">Red lines the streets of opportunity,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">corridors narrowing with every stroke.</span>
          <span class="line">Jealousy burns the city of success,</span>
          <span class="line">a quiet fire, buried in cinders,</span>
          <span class="line">smoke settling on dreams broken and torn.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 4 -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">A pool, buried in a park,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">water drained rather than shared.</span>
          <span class="line">A Confederate statue, torn apart,</span>
          <span class="line">finally yielding to the weight of history,</span>
          <span class="line">the true purpose, hate, was never a mystery.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 5 -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">They carved out "race" from smoke and air,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">a fiction built to sort and rank.</span>
          <span class="line">"My neighbor is my enemy."</span>
          <span class="line">A tale of difference, sharp and deep,</span>
          <span class="line">so those in power, power keep.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 6 -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">But boundaries are brittle</span>
          <span class="line line--red">when held up to the light.</span>
          <span class="line">They crack at the touch</span>
          <span class="line">of a truth long known</span>
          <span class="line">but spoken in whispers.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line">Voices once muted</span>
          <span class="line">rise in a hum, then a chorus.</span>
          <span class="line line--gold">Change rarely shouts at first;</span>
          <span class="line line--gold">it gathers, slow breath, soft step,</span>
          <span class="line line--gold">until silence can no longer hold.</span>

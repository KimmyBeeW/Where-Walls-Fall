terracotta tiles with white cracks representing red lining, a red 
flame on a black background representing the Tulsa Massacre, earthy and grassy tones 
covering blue tiles to represent the public pools that were paved over because white 
people would rather lose their pools that swim together with black people, brown tiles 
scattered among a cream background representing the long walk people take to cross the 
border for dreams that may never be realized, all swirling together to a golden center 
that represents the hope for a better tomorrow (I know it's cheesy). - Kimmy"

        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">A pool, buried in a park,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">water drained rather than shared.</span>
          <span class="line">A Confederate flag, torn apart,</span>

        alt="A butterfly made of multicolored glass shards and small stones, is centered on a reflective, grid-textured background. Its wings are bordered with silver chain, decorated with white stones and black feathers, and surrounded at the top and bottom by jagged, colorful stained-glass triangles."  
      >
      <p class="mosaic-description">"Systemic Metamorphosis" - This piece reflects the evolving forms of systemic racism in the United States, from slavery to the Jim Crow era to modern mass incarceration. The butterfly, seemingly beautiful at first glance, is marked by crow feathers that evoke Jim Crow and the failures of Reconstruction. The chains reveal the ongoing reality of systemic oppression, particularly through mass incarceration. The work also highlights the irony of punitive immigration policies. Walls built to keep people out ultimately confine immigrants within harm’s reach and inflict damage on both immigrant communities and U.S.-born citizens.</p>

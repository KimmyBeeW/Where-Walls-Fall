              himself, said unto Jesus, And <em><b>who</b></em> is my neighbour? And Jesus answering 
              said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which 
              stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And 
              by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed 
              by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked 
              on him, and passed by on the other side. But <em><b>a certain Samaritan</b></em>, as he journeyed, 
              came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and 
              bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought 
              him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out 
              two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever 
              thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. <em><b>Which now of these three</b></em>, 
              thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said, <em><b>He 
              that shewed mercy on him.</b></em> Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."</span>

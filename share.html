flowing patterns of different sections of color and texture. The sections are:
terracotta tiles with white cracks on a red background representing red lining, a red 
flame on a black background representing the Tulsa Massacre, earthy and grassy tones 
covering blue tiles to represent the public pools that were paved over because white 
people would rather lose their pools that swim together with black people, brown tiles 
scattered among a cream background representing the long walk people take to cross the 
border for dreams that may never be realized, all swirling together to a golden center 
that represents the hope for a better tomorrow (I know it's cheesy). - Kimmy"

          History lives not just in textbooks, but in the stories we tell, 
          the art we create, and the truths we refuse to let fade. 
          Your voice matters in this ongoing conversation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We invite you to share your own art, poetry, music, or reflections 
          on the history of racism in America. Whether it's a family story 
          passed down through generations, a piece inspired by what you've learned, 
          or a vision for the future you want to build. <strong>Your perspective adds to the mosaic.</strong>

          Together, we create a chorus of voices that cannot be silenced. 
          Every share, every story, every piece of art chips away at the walls 
          that divide us.

            This butterfly represents transformation shaped from many fragmented pieces. Each shard, bead, and feather reflects a different influence or experience, showing how identity is built from diverse origins rather than a single story. The jagged stained-glass points surrounding it echo the pressures and tensions that come from living in a world shaped by racial boundaries, yet the butterfly remains whole, resilient, and undeniably beautiful. It suggests that even in the midst of brokenness or conflict, something new and strong can emerge. It's a reminder that race and ethnicity are lived stories made from many parts, not fixed categories.
